Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food,
and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax
applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.

When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items
and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items(including taxes).
The rounding rule is to nearest 5 cent.

Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping baskets:

INPUT:

Input 1:
1 book at 12.49
1 music CD at 14.99
1 chocolate at 0.85

Input 2:
2 imported chocolate at 10.00
1 imported bottle of perfume at 47.50
